# Aim

- Implement [this](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.07015.pdf) state of the art time series forecasting model in MXNet.
- Apply to thousands of stocks in parallel and maximize recall
- Once functioning correctly source data at a higher frequency

## To do

1. Does my skip-connection between rnn cells do what it should?
2. Which side of the input gets padded?????? I am currently padding future side (bottom of array)
3. Get timeseries reading in with all data
4. Confirm AR component is correct
